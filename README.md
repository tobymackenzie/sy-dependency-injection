==========

Convenient helpers for working with Symfony's dependency injection and config components.  Currently has the classes:

- `MultiPathLoader` for easily loading files from multiple absolute paths for the same container.
- `MultiTypeLoader` for easily handling loading the supported types of configuration for the same container and path(s).
